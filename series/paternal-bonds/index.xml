      <description>&amp;lsquo;Ferguson&amp;#x2026; John Ferguson. Oh yeah&amp;#x2026;&amp;rsquo;
John was loving it. This was the smooth ride that could only come from a car that was inspected and tested by hand at every step of its manufacture. It handled like butter. Shaken or stirred? There would be neither in this vehicle. Everything was still and beautiful like a pond with no breeze. This was the car to end all cars. For John, it didn&amp;rsquo;t get better than this.</description>
