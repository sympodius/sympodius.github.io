      <p>I&rsquo;m alive! You might not believe me, but I totally am.
Yes, it&rsquo;s been a year since I posted anything here. Yes, the last thing I posted was the previous year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Year in Review.&rsquo; Yes, I can list agreements&hellip; but I did lots of stuff this year&hellip; LOTS of stuff!
It is disappointing that I didn&rsquo;t post more. You would be correct in thinking that this is representative of my writing output for the year.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://johnurquhartferguson.info/post/musings-on-writing-2017-year-in-review/">Musings on Writing - 2017 Year in Review</a></h3>
      <p>Greetings, Programs! During my Christmas break, I took some time to reflect on my previous year of writing. It was in December 2016 that I first decided to rework my writing setup and, one year later, I was considering whether I&rsquo;d achieved my goals.
Actually, there were only two goals: write more, and write better. The problem is that I&rsquo;m a classic yak shaver. On my way to achieving those goals I determined that I needed new writing software, new website software, the ability to easily publish to multiple formats, a dedicated writing computer, a new computer keyboard, a writing bag, a marketing strategy, a better choice of fonts for both writing and publishing&hellip;</p>

      <p>I have another cinema story for you. My local film theatre has an option called &lsquo;VIP.&rsquo; In addition to the improved seating and unlimited snacks, your ticket grants access to a pre-film, all-you-can-eat buffet. After getting my money&rsquo;s worth much quicker than expected, I had a good half hour to enjoy before I would be needed in the cinema hall. I decided to spend the time visiting the water closet in the hopes of securing a more settled and comfortable experience while the film was showing.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://johnurquhartferguson.info/post/how-i-write-my-website-software/">How I Write - My Website Software</a></h3>
      <p>An email has come flooding in to request information about the website software I use. So then, technical minded readers and enthusiastic neophytes alike, let us take a journey into the web.
This is the second post in a series about how I do my writing. The first post introduced you to my writing software, Emacs. I mentioned that one of its benefits was that I was able to write everything in one place and then have it &lsquo;publish&rsquo; to lots of different places with very little effort.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://johnurquhartferguson.info/post/how-i-write-my-writing-software/">How I Write - My Writing Software</a></h3>
      <p>Are you ready to learn about the overly complicated system I use for my writing? I&rsquo;m not sure that I would be, but apparently a few of you are desperate to find out. At least, that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m led to believe by the overwhelming number of requests (there were three) I&rsquo;ve had to write this series of articles.
The plan is to talk through some software and hardware that I use for writing.</p>

      <p>I saw a horror film last weekend at the cinema. It&rsquo;s easy to take movies for granted with the near constant access we have to them: Phones, laptops, televisions, virtual reality home theatres, mixed reality projections into the sky&hellip; At any given moment most of us have immediate access to films but, at least for me, these options tend to encourage casual viewing. When it&rsquo;s so easy to have a film playing wherever I am, I tend to have it playing in the background.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://johnurquhartferguson.info/post/one-month-on/">One Month On</a></h3>
      <p>For each of us, there will be some beliefs to which we hold a firm grasp. These few ideals will form the core that is an essential part of our character. For some, a core belief might be loyalty to friends and family. Others might favour helping those in need. The more light-hearted among us might feel that bringing laughter to the world is central to our humanity.
I am no different in my need for core beliefs and today I thought I would share one of them with you: I believe in making the time to fail.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://johnurquhartferguson.info/post/rebrand/">reBRAND</a></h3>
      <p>I&rsquo;ve been working on a secret project since the beginning of December 2016 (or not so secret if you&rsquo;ve spoken to me for more than five minutes over the last four months). If you&rsquo;re here today (April Fools Day, 2017), you will be seeing part of that project. Welcome to the redesign of johnurquhartferguson.info!
The old site had been showing its age and I felt it needed to be refreshed. I&rsquo;d also been a little unhappy with the &lsquo;writing&rsquo; section of that site.</p>

      <h3><a href="https://johnurquhartferguson.info/post/motivation-and-happiness/">Motivation and Happiness</a></h3>
      <p>Something has been on my mind for a while concerning the sad lack of updates to this site. A few years ago, I had what might be called &lsquo;an identity crisis.&rsquo; I had lost sense of who I was and what I wanted. I realise I&rsquo;m not unique in these particular pontifications, but perhaps my own peculiar eccentricities in dealing with them may prove interesting to you.
My main worry was a simple question: am I happy?</p>

      <p>Thank you so much to all of you for reading my stories! It is greatly encouraging to know that people are reading the things I write.
People have been particularly kind in their praise of my ideas. That is really wonderful to hear and makes me think this is all worthwhile. I am writing these short stories so that I can improve, and for that I need your help.
It&rsquo;s so encouraging to see the hit count increase when I publish a new chapter, but I also value direct feedback.</p>
