      <description>Greetings, Programs! During my Christmas break, I took some time to reflect on my previous year of writing. It was in December 2016 that I first decided to rework my writing setup and, one year later, I was considering whether I&amp;rsquo;d achieved my goals.
Actually, there were only two goals: write more, and write better. The problem is that I&amp;rsquo;m a classic yak shaver. On my way to achieving those goals I determined that I needed new writing software, new website software, the ability to easily publish to multiple formats, a dedicated writing computer, a new computer keyboard, a writing bag, a marketing strategy, a better choice of fonts for both writing and publishing&amp;hellip;</description>

      <title>Thought Factory - Self Reliance and Waiting for Permission</title>

      <description>I have another cinema story for you. My local film theatre has an option called &amp;lsquo;VIP.&amp;rsquo; In addition to the improved seating and unlimited snacks, your ticket grants access to a pre-film, all-you-can-eat buffet. After getting my money&amp;rsquo;s worth much quicker than expected, I had a good half hour to enjoy before I would be needed in the cinema hall. I decided to spend the time visiting the water closet in the hopes of securing a more settled and comfortable experience while the film was showing.</description>

      <description>An email has come flooding in to request information about the website software I use. So then, technical minded readers and enthusiastic neophytes alike, let us take a journey into the web.
This is the second post in a series about how I do my writing. The first post introduced you to my writing software, Emacs. I mentioned that one of its benefits was that I was able to write everything in one place and then have it &amp;lsquo;publish&amp;rsquo; to lots of different places with very little effort.</description>

      <description>Are you ready to learn about the overly complicated system I use for my writing? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I would be, but apparently a few of you are desperate to find out. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m led to believe by the overwhelming number of requests (there were three) I&amp;rsquo;ve had to write this series of articles.
The plan is to talk through some software and hardware that I use for writing.</description>

      <description>I saw a horror film last weekend at the cinema. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to take movies for granted with the near constant access we have to them: Phones, laptops, televisions, virtual reality home theatres, mixed reality projections into the sky&amp;hellip; At any given moment most of us have immediate access to films but, at least for me, these options tend to encourage casual viewing. When it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to have a film playing wherever I am, I tend to have it playing in the background.</description>

      <description>For each of us, there will be some beliefs to which we hold a firm grasp. These few ideals will form the core that is an essential part of our character. For some, a core belief might be loyalty to friends and family. Others might favour helping those in need. The more light-hearted among us might feel that bringing laughter to the world is central to our humanity.
I am no different in my need for core beliefs and today I thought I would share one of them with you: I believe in making the time to fail.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Do you want anything from the coffee shop, Julia?&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;No, I&amp;rsquo;m fine thanks, Coco.&amp;rdquo;
Coco put on her jacket and slung her bag around her shoulder as she headed for the door. Julia and Coco shared a small room together. Just two desks amid a sea of folders and loose paper.
As she opened and closed the office door behind her, Coco smiled at the logo printed on the glass which read, I should Coco.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a secret project since the beginning of December 2016 (or not so secret if you&amp;rsquo;ve spoken to me for more than five minutes over the last four months). If you&amp;rsquo;re here today (April Fools Day, 2017), you will be seeing part of that project. Welcome to the redesign of johnurquhartferguson.info!
The old site had been showing its age and I felt it needed to be refreshed. I&amp;rsquo;d also been a little unhappy with the &amp;lsquo;writing&amp;rsquo; section of that site.</description>

      <description>The two souls were back. They felt like they had spent an eternity in this hospital room. Part of them longed to be back at the pool, but greater still was their need to be part of these lives.
In a wordless compromise, the souls left the hospital room to seek the shore next to the pool. At least they could see that peaceful place once more while they made their decision.</description>

      <description>Who is JUF My name is John Urquhart Ferguson and I like to explore my own creativity. I enjoy writing, making films and taking photographs. I enjoy other things as well, but that&#39;s enough to be going on with. Have a look around and let me know what you think.
This site is mostly a place for me to put my writing. If that&#39;s the sort of thing you&#39;re interested in, you can scroll down to find out more about it or jump straight to my blog and stories sections.</description>

      <description>Something has been on my mind for a while concerning the sad lack of updates to this site. A few years ago, I had what might be called &amp;lsquo;an identity crisis.&amp;rsquo; I had lost sense of who I was and what I wanted. I realise I&amp;rsquo;m not unique in these particular pontifications, but perhaps my own peculiar eccentricities in dealing with them may prove interesting to you.
My main worry was a simple question: am I happy?</description>

      <description>The world was now a fog with no pictures, not even the indistinct images from before.
The souls knew each others minds completely now, but they continued to speak out loud. Their thought process was still based on conversations, even if they were only talking to themselves.
The younger soul spoke first, &amp;ldquo;I think Coco&amp;rsquo;s life may not be so bad as we first feared.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;We can but hope, Sister-brother. At least we know that her path is open to many possibilities.</description>

      <description>Time flickered past the two new souls as they saw everything blur around them. Everything seemed out of focus except for the girl.
Ashley Brown&amp;rsquo;s child was female. While the rest of this life was only the most probable path, that truth had been set before the souls became involved.
As the visions of childhood passed by, the younger soul saw brief images of pain and struggle. The child was named, &amp;rsquo;Coco.</description>

      <description>Thank you so much to all of you for reading my stories! It is greatly encouraging to know that people are reading the things I write.
People have been particularly kind in their praise of my ideas. That is really wonderful to hear and makes me think this is all worthwhile. I am writing these short stories so that I can improve, and for that I need your help.
It&amp;rsquo;s so encouraging to see the hit count increase when I publish a new chapter, but I also value direct feedback.</description>

      <description>There was nothing here but the pool. That&amp;rsquo;s how it always started. A single pool of undefined soul fragments mingling together without individuality. It was neither a single soul, nor many souls together. It was simply a pool of potential.
There were other souls out there, beyond this place. Those souls had already taken shape and were living lives. And, once they were finished, they would return to the pool again, broken apart to spread what they had learned.</description>

      <description>Living life is like following a series of connected paths. When you&amp;rsquo;re trying to determine which path to follow, you only have the signs to help you choose. You cannot see into the distance to where the paths will actually lead and the signs can sometimes be misleading. We make many choices in our lives and each choice leads us along a path. Many of the paths look similar at the beginning but once we follow one, we can never know where the others may have led.</description>

      <description>The second story I&amp;rsquo;ve been cooking up is not all that different from the first. I mean, the actual story is totally different, but I think it has a similar feel and explores related issues. Dasein was about exploring whether we are real or have free will, but I think the next story, &amp;lsquo;Soulstice,&amp;rsquo; is about the ways our existence is affected by free will. The story also tries to explore whether free will is really that important in our lives, or if luck and circumstance play a bigger part.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;I assume you think of me as unreal,&amp;rdquo; said the figure. &amp;ldquo;That I am merely a character from your story. I am sure, then, that it will come as a shock to find out that you are only half correct.&amp;rdquo;
Martin had lost all feeling in his body. All he could do was look on and listen to the figure&amp;rsquo;s distorted voice.
&amp;ldquo;You see, Martin, I am not real. My actions are not under my control at all.</description>

      <description>Martin felt his throat become thick and heavy, but managed to open his mouth and confront the killer.
&amp;ldquo;Do not leave,&amp;rdquo; Martin told the figure. &amp;ldquo;I am your creator. You have entered into my world and you have no place here. You must not run. I must destroy you before you damage this universe.&amp;rdquo;
The figure began to speak in a distorted voice. It did not come from his mouth. It seemed to come from everywhere.</description>

      <description>As soon as Martin admitted to himself that he was powerless, he was released. He sat up in bed, waiting to see if he had the will to move around. The restrictions seemed to be gone. He wondered if it was really true though.
If he did not have the control to break fictional bonds on him, how could he be sure someone was not controlling him now? Perhaps someone was anticipating all the movements he wanted to make, then making them for him.</description>

      <description>Martin sat in his kitchen looking dazed and confused. He coddled his warm mug of coffee in his hands and tried not to think about what was happening. Instead, he tried to think about what he was going to do at the weekend, but immediately felt uneasy. He tried to think of nothing at all and simply stare into space but he could not get the images out of his mind.</description>

      <description>The first story on the website is &amp;lsquo;Dasein.&amp;rsquo; I&amp;rsquo;ll put my cards on the table right away: I wrote this a while ago. Probably six years ago. I was trying to explore some philosophical ideas I&amp;rsquo;d been reading about and see if I could inspire myself to create something with them for academic purposes. Sadly, I never managed to come up with a really interesting discovery in that area, but I still think this is a fun story.</description>

      <description>Sometimes it can be hard to tell when the present began. It seems easy to remember the past and plan for the future, but when does the current become just a memory? When do your visions of tomorrow have life thrust into them and become the immediate part of your linear existence? Is your experience just a series of present moments or is it the totality of all the moments past?</description>

      <description>A Dasein is a being in the world. The Dasein recognizes the place one has in time and space: that all beings are linked together with their Universe, their Being. They are all part of the one.
The Dasein will acknowledge his fate. He knows that he has no will of his own. He is a product of his environment and his Being. The Dasein must be authentic to himself or he will never be at peace.</description>

      <description>I hope that this site will shortly see some activity in the form of stories. I hope to write one story each month. It&amp;rsquo;s not a strict schedule by any means and I may not publish entire stories in one go.
I could go for a serialised format if it takes my fancy. It always adds a little excitement knowing that you can&amp;rsquo;t go back and edit something when you&amp;rsquo;re half way through a story (then again, the Internet makes anything possible).</description>

      <description>&amp;rsquo;Ferguson&amp;#x2026; John Ferguson. Oh yeah&amp;#x2026;&amp;rsquo;
John was loving it. This was the smooth ride that could only come from a car that was inspected and tested by hand at every step of its manufacture. It handled like butter. Shaken or stirred? There would be neither in this vehicle. Everything was still and beautiful like a pond with no breeze. This was the car to end all cars. For John, it didn&amp;rsquo;t get better than this.</description>

      <description>The wind blew through his hair as he flew on the clouds. Or, at least, it would have if his hair hadn&amp;rsquo;t been impervious to such things. He didn&amp;rsquo;t mind though because his cape had a nice flappiness about it which he had always found very appealing. He often wondered if the scientists on his home world had spent a lot of time perfecting such a wonderfully flappy cape, but that was silly.</description>
