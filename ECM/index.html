			<h2>Welcome to the ECM</h2>
			<div class="indentBlock">
				<p>I passed a couch on the road today. Someone had dumped it there as an open invitation, “Please take this. My garbage is your future.”</p>
				<p>What a waste.</p>
				<p>It looked brand new. What an odd expression that is. It implies something that was just forged with a firebrand. But what brand was this couch? AVSAKNAD? Tími? It doesn’t even matter. They all look the same to me now. Homes filled with the same low grade crap so that everyone is alike. The rich pay more for the same shit to make them feel they’re better. The poor have to work twice as hard to pay less. Everything built to perish quickly so that we have to buy replacements. Even then, you see this: A brand new couch on the side of the road. We’re so in love with buying that we need to throw out what we have so that we can buy more. What’s the fucking sense in that?</p>
				<p>What a waste.</p>
				<p>Did you ever stop to think what you’re doing it for?</p>
				<p>You’ve worked hard for your money, why waste it on something you're only buying because a billboard told you it would make you happy? Why do we hoard all these things? We’re just turning ourselves into brands and losing our humanity.</p>
				<p>What a waste.</p>
				<p>I bought a bottle of water this morning. It was collected in Italy somewhere. Tuscany, I think. What does that say about me? I chose to buy it. I handed over money. Doesn’t that mean I support them? The thing is, I don’t think I do. I was just thirsty, I didn’t want someone to go to Italy and fetch me some water. Think of the fuel that wasted. Think of the needlessness of it all. All for something I didn’t even care about. But now they have my choice and my money. Now I’m their statistic. Me and all the rest. I’m the proof that what they’re doing is right. “This is what the people want. We’ve got proof.”</p>
				<p>What a waste.</p>
				<p>I spent four month’s worth of wages on a painting once. I put it on my wall and showed it off to guests when they came to see me. What was I trying to say? “Hey, I’m successful enough to afford this?” “Look at how good my taste is?” “Doesn’t this just sum up everything about who I am as a person? Like, the REAL me?”</p>
				<p>The truth is that I wanted it, so I bought it. I wasn’t going to do anything with it. I sometimes look at it, but it’s mostly in the background. I told myself it was important to me, that I had some personal and emotional connection to it. But the truth is I was just being selfish. I’ve prevented other people from enjoying it. I took something that no one has a right to own and made myself its sole custodian. Fuck, I even felt like I’d achieved something.</p>
				<p>This isn’t who I want to be anymore. I’m sick of working at a job I don’t like to get money I don’t need to spend on things I don’t want. Most of the jobs now just enable manufacturing. We’re all working to make things and get money, so that we can spend money on those things. What if we just stopped?</p>
				<p>Imagine if we stopped buying the shit. What if I only bought what I needed? What if I didn’t turn my apartment into some existential reflection of who I think I want to be? What if we all just stopped?</p>
				<p>The important jobs would be there, but the pointless ones would go. No more making pens with torches on the end and a corporate logo on the shaft. We wouldn’t need as much money because we’d have none of the useless crap to spend it on. We could divide up the necessary jobs between the larger workforce because no one wants the money any more. We’d all have more free time to live fulfilling lives of learning and artistic achievement without losing the important parts of the infrastructure that keep our world going. We’d pour money into education and culture and all would have free access. No one would hoard art anymore.</p>
				<p>We wouldn’t work at jobs for money. We’d work on ourselves for fulfilment. That’s true happiness.</p>
				<p>We’d be less focused on ourselves. We could spend more time with each other and care more for each other. That’s true happiness.</p>
				<p>It could work. And it all starts with a simple decision: Make better choices.</p>

			<br>
			<p>Fellow consumers,</p>
			<p>The above was written by Lynette Buchanan. She was the spark that lit the flame of the ECM. She showed us that we are no longer individuals. We are just targets for a corporate hegemony. Since we were children, we have been told that we can be anything we want to be. We’ve been told that our world is full of variety, individuality and choice. We have freedoms and abilities that our ancestors could only dream of. All we have to do is work hard, get a good job and everything will work out for us. But that was never the real message.</p>
			<p>The real message was always to buy. Be who you want to be (just buy the clothes that prove it). Enjoy what the world has to offer (as long as you’re buying those offerings from us). Choose the lifestyle that makes you happy (‘Lifestyle-24-B’ now shipping from our on-line store). You are what you buy and they’re the ones selling. You’re not buying a lifestyle, you’re buying THEIR lifestyle. The one they want you to have because it keeps the whole system rolling. Do you even know who you are?</p>
			<p>We are not meat machines. We have no need for your labels to be affixed to us. We will not be branded with your watered down version of humanity. We will not work for you to produce the labels that enslave others.</p>
			<p>We will make the choice. We will choose to reject your ideal. We do not want chaos or collapse or to throw away what humanity has accomplished, we just want it to be better. We will take the infrastructure, the novelty and the merits of our modern world and turn it toward a better goal. We will take the art and expression and turn it toward introspection and acknowledge the singularity of our human souls.</p>
			<p>This is not a threat. There will be no battle or ultimatum. This is an invitation.</p>
			<p>We can be better. You can be better. Join us back in the human race or stay behind to be swallowed up by history. All are welcome. Join us.</p>
			<p>Empathy,</p>
			<p>- ECM</p>

			<h2>WHAT</h2>
			<h4><strong>MAKING BETTER CHOICES</strong></h4>
			<p>Ethical Capitalism understands the benefits and developments created by a society that has focused mainly on profit as its key driving force, yet it believes that a new era in our society's progress must come from a position focusing on community, sparsity, ecology and equality.</p>
			<p>By creating new networks, demonstrating against unreasonable practice in the commercial sector and developing public awareness we can change our world for the benefit of all.</p>
			<p>The first step is to reject what they’ve told you and vote with your wallet. Capitalism has been the strongest driving force the world has ever known, and we are all part of it. If we all choose a new path together, capitalism will match us accordingly. This is the basis of the ethical capitalism movement. We want to keep the good things that capitalism has created, but ditch the rest that made us lose ourselves and our humanity.</p>

<div id="how" class="container-fluid slideanim">
	<h2>HOW</h2>
	<h4>METHODOLOGIES TO CREATE A BETTER WORLD</h4>
	<p>The better world starts with you. So often, our future happiness comes down to a choice. That choice is upon you now. We hope you will come on this journey with us. We are all all pebbles falling into the stream. One of us may not stop the water flowing, but all of us will divert the stream.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div class="row text-center">
		<div class="col-sm-6 lowerPadding">
			<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-home logo-small"></span>
			<h4>YOUR HOME</h4>
			<p>Go through your home and scan the things you own. How many of those items are necessary? How many do you use everyday? Do you have more than you truly need? Everything in your home should come under two headings: things that I need to comfortably survive and things I need to be more fulfilled.</p>
			<p>The first one is easy. We need items to keep us nutritiously fed (no more processed foods or unhealthy ingredients. Make everything yourself from wholesome base products that were ethically sourced). We need to be warm (heating and blankets are not a luxury, but that fine silk throw, hand woven by the children of Malaysia with a designer label on it, is unnecessary). We need to be comfortable (a good chair or bed made without resorting to sweat shop labour is not an indulgence). Take care of yourself and your physical needs, but not at the expense of others.</p>
			<p>The second heading is harder. What do we need to be fulfilled? We’ve been blasted with advertising our whole lives to tell us what it is to be fulfilled and happy, but do you really feel that way? Ask yourself if you really need a large screen television so that big corporations can sell you their view of the world and another lifestyle for you to buy. Wouldn’t you be happier learning to paint? Wouldn’t it be more satisfying to take up knitting and make your own jumper? Do you really need that art on the wall so you can glance at it once a year? Wouldn’t it be more satisfying to go to a museum and share that experience actively with others?  Do you really need that popcorn maker? Is that sous-vide machine making you happy? Why not learn to be self sufficient? Tools to create and craft are worth more in the right hands than the products they make.</p>
			<p>Reduce what you own. Get rid of the things that don’t help you survive or feel fulfilled. Don’t be sentimental about things. You are not what you own. Your memories are in you, not the objects you possess. Get a smaller place that’s easier to look after and less of a worry for you. Only live somewhere that is big enough, but no more. Share your space with others if necessary. Don’t waste money on the hardwood floors and the open atrium. Get out into the world to enjoy its beauty. Come home to rest and introspect.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6 lowerPadding">
			<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-barcode logo-small"></span>
			<h4>YOUR MONEY</h4>
			<p>When you buy something, two things happen: You say something about yourself and you say something to the seller. What you say about yourself is that you do or do not care where the item came from. You do or do not care how it was made. You do or do not care how it got to you.</p>
			<p>You are also saying that this product is part of your identity now. If we care about who we are and what kind of a people we want to be, we must be vigilant about what we buy.</p>
			<p>What you are saying to the seller is that you agree with everything about this product. You agree with where it came from, how it was made and how it came to you. You agree with the advertising message that sold it to you and you agree with the larger ethics of the companies involved in making and getting it to you. These companies do not care about the nuances of that choice. They don’t care that you didn’t put all that thought into your purchase. They simply know you bought it, and their only option is to assume the rest. If we want to send a message to these companies that we care about other people and our world, we must be vigilant about what we buy.</p>
			<p>Do not buy what you do not need. Do not buy things because an advert told you to. Do not buy things that will not make you happy. Do not buy things that perpetrate the suffering of others.</p>
		</div>
    </div>
	<div class="row text-center">
		<div class="col-sm-6 lowerPadding">
			<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-wrench logo-small"></span>
			<h4>YOUR JOB</h4>
			<p>There are three reasons to work. The first is to make money to survive. The second is to make money to buy things. The third is for self-satisfaction.</p>
			<p>If you make money to survive, this is fine. If possible, try to get a job that does not contribute to making commercial products, but rather supplies services or infrastructure which you feel contributes to society.</p>
			<p>If you make money to buy things, you are in the wrong job. If you are making money to buy things then you have already reached a viable level of financial security to allow for survival. You are now working to excess. Work less, make less money, buy less things and put that saved time and money toward something more fulfilling. </p>
			<p>If you work for self-satisfaction, you are in a fortunate position. However, try to keep in mind that your satisfaction is not worth the suffering of others. Even if you find you job fulfilling, you should seek other employment if it comes at the cost of others suffering or in making products that contribute to the cycle of consumerism and unfulfilled lives.</p>
			<p>In an ideal world we would all have job satisfaction and work on something that benefited society, but this is rarely possible. You must remember that you are not your job. You can be fulfilled without enjoying your work. But, it is easier if you work to the minimum for survival and work on something that improves the lives of others. We can look to our time away from work for self-fulfilment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="col-sm-6 lowerPadding">
			<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-user logo-small"></span>
			<h4>YOURSELF</h4>
			<p>Everyone will find fulfilment in different ways. Some may take to art. Others may take to science. Some may take to reading. Others may take to running. There is no right path to self-fulfilment other than listening to yourself and being ready to explore all possibilities.</p>
			<p>Try anything and everything, but always take time to reflect on how those things made you feel. Keep in mind that not all activities for self-improvement need to be solo pursuits. You may prefer to come together as a group and explore the potential of team activities and projects.</p>
			<p>Also, do not be limited by time. If a project will demand more concerted effort than the days you are not working, you may be more fulfilled by working five or six days a week and saving up enough to then work solidly on a project for six months to a year. The important thing is to do what feels right to you and, whenever possible, to help others find their fulfilment as well. For some people, this act may be the most fulfilling thing of all.</p>
			<p>Be part of each others lives. Once we are all being the best people we can be, we must then be the best community we can be. We are all individuals, and bringing all that wonderful uniqueness together can create the greatest achievement of all: Humanity, peace and a better world for us all.</p>
