      <description>An email has come flooding in to request information about the website software I use. So then, technical minded readers and enthusiastic neophytes alike, let us take a journey into the web.
This is the second post in a series about how I do my writing. The first post introduced you to my writing software, Emacs. I mentioned that one of its benefits was that I was able to write everything in one place and then have it &amp;lsquo;publish&amp;rsquo; to lots of different places with very little effort.</description>

      <description>Are you ready to learn about the overly complicated system I use for my writing? I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that I would be, but apparently a few of you are desperate to find out. At least, that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;m led to believe by the overwhelming number of requests (there were three) I&amp;rsquo;ve had to write this series of articles.
The plan is to talk through some software and hardware that I use for writing.</description>
