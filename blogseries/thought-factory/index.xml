      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since I wrote a blog post (I wonder how many of the 2.5 million blog posts written today will start that way). It&amp;rsquo;s also been a strange and terrifying year. Today I want to put the terrifying to the side and concentrate on the strange. For me, the strangest thing (and certainly the first of its kind in my lifetime) was the lockdown.
There is something both encouraging and depressing about the lockdown.</description>

      <description>I have another cinema story for you. My local film theatre has an option called &amp;lsquo;VIP.&amp;rsquo; In addition to the improved seating and unlimited snacks, your ticket grants access to a pre-film, all-you-can-eat buffet. After getting my money&amp;rsquo;s worth much quicker than expected, I had a good half hour to enjoy before I would be needed in the cinema hall. I decided to spend the time visiting the water closet in the hopes of securing a more settled and comfortable experience while the film was showing.</description>

      <description>I saw a horror film last weekend at the cinema. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to take movies for granted with the near constant access we have to them: Phones, laptops, televisions, virtual reality home theatres, mixed reality projections into the sky&amp;hellip; At any given moment most of us have immediate access to films but, at least for me, these options tend to encourage casual viewing. When it&amp;rsquo;s so easy to have a film playing wherever I am, I tend to have it playing in the background.</description>
